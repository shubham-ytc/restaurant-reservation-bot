## 🚀 Key Features

### ✅ Chatbot-Based Reservation Booking
Users can interact naturally to:

- Book a table
- Select number of guests
- Choose available time slots
- Confirm reservations instantly

---

### ✅ Compressed Menu Data
Instead of loading the entire restaurant menu every time, the chatbot stores and serves a compressed menu format:

- Menu grouped by categories
- Reduced storage and faster responses

Example:

```json
{
  "Starters": ["Soup", "Salad"],
  "Main Course": ["Pizza", "Pasta"],
  "Desserts": ["Ice Cream"]
}
